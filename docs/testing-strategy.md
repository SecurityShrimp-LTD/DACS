# Testing strategy

Five tiers, each with a different cost and a different question it answers.
A rule must pass every tier below the one it claims.

| Tier | Question it answers | Tool | Runs | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Schema and lint | Is the rule well formed and documented | tools/validate_rules.py | Every PR | Seconds |
| 2. Compile | Does it translate to our query language | sigma convert | Every PR | Seconds |
| 3. Fixture replay | Does the logic match known bad and ignore known good | pytest, tests/data | Every PR | Seconds |
| 4. Detonation | Does the real technique produce the real telemetry | flightsim, Atomic Red Team, Stratus Red Team | Nightly | Minutes |
| 5. End to end assertion | Did the alert actually appear in the SIEM | Threatest | Nightly | Minutes to hours |
| 6. Adversarial | Does it survive an operator who is trying to evade it | Purple team exercise | Quarterly | Days |

## What each tier does not prove

- Tier 1 to 3 prove form and logic. They prove nothing about telemetry. A rule
  can pass all three while the log source has been dark for a month.
- Tier 4 proves telemetry arrives. It does not prove the rule fired.
- Tier 5 proves the alert fired for the canonical procedure. It says nothing
  about precision and nothing about the variants the rule misses.
- Only tier 6 tests the rule against an adversary who knows it exists. Record the
  results in the Blind Spots section of the ADS, which is the artifact that
  carries this knowledge forward.

## Detonation safety rules

1. Detonation runs from a dedicated host with a dedicated egress address. Never
   from a shared workstation and never from a clinical, OT or production segment
   without written approval and a change window.
2. flightsim contacts live command and control infrastructure to build its
   destination list. Your egress address will appear in third party telemetry
   reaching out to known bad destinations. Get that acknowledged in advance by
   whoever owns the address space.
3. The scan and spambot modules are excluded from scheduled runs. scan can trip
   IPS blocking and lock out the detonation host, spambot can get the egress
   range listed.
4. tunnel-icmp requires superuser privileges on the detonation host.
5. Every scheduled run is announced to the SOC with the run marker, so a
   detonation is never mistaken for an incident. Unannounced detonation is a
   purple team exercise, which is a different activity with a different approval.

## Blocked is not the same as undetected

If a detonation produces no alert, determine which of these happened before
touching the rule:

1. A control blocked the traffic and logged it. That is a pass for the control
   and a pass for visibility.
2. A control blocked the traffic and did not log it. That is a visibility gap.
   Open a telemetry ticket, not a tuning ticket.
3. The traffic went out, was logged, and no rule matched. That is a detection
   gap. Tune the rule.
4. The traffic went out and was not logged. That is a collection gap. Escalate to
   the platform team.

Reporting all four cases as "detection failed" is the fastest way to lose
credibility with the platform and network teams.

## Correlation

Threatest assigns a UUID to each detonation and binds the matched alert to it,
which is what keeps assertions from passing on unrelated alerts of the same name.
flightsim does not do this. When flightsim is used as the detonator, the
assertion binds on signal name plus time window plus source address, so the
detonation host must not share its address with anything else that could trip
the same rule. The nightly workflow wraps flightsim in a parent process carrying
a run marker so the SIEM has something to correlate against, which is the same
approach the Threatest SSH detonator uses.
